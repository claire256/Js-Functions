FUNCTIONS
-I understand functions as a set of statements or procedures that perform a task or calculates a value.
-For a procudre to be as a function, it should take an input and return an output.To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
-Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, and The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}.
-Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. A function receives values when called or evoked that is the arguments.
-With function Ivocation, the code inside the functon will be executed or triggered when a function is called or ivoked, without calling it, the fuction will not be triggered.


Arrays
-JavaScript Array is a single variable that is used to store elements of different data types.
-Any element in the array can be accessed using the index number. The index in the arrays starts with 0 and not one. There are 3 ways to construct array in JavaScript : By array literal, By creating instance of Array directly (using new keyword), and By using an Array constructor (using new keyword). 
-Arrays provide a lot of methods. To make things easier. They include the following in summary:

* Array length- this returns the length of an array.
* toString()  - converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values.
* pop()       - removes the last element from an array.
* push()      - adds a new element to an array (at the end).
* shift()     - removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.
* concat()    - creates a new array by merging existing arrays.
* splice()    - adds new items to an array.
* slice()     - slices out a piece of an array.
* unshift()   - adds a new element to an array at the beginning, and "unshifts" older elements.
* flat()      - creates a new array with sub-array elements concatenated.
And many more, as those are the common ones.


Conditional Statements

1) If/Else statements.
They are used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false. The else if statement is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

2) Switch statements.
switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. With switch statement the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case, If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed and If there is no match, the default code block is executed. 
The switch expression is evaluated once.

3)Loops
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a certain condition

1) For loop
For loop statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions: first expression (executed (one time) before the execution of the code block), second expression (defines the condition for executing the code block) and third statement ( executed (every time) after the code block has been executed).

2) While Loop
A while loop repeats itself while something is true, continues until the condition is false. So you have to make sure the code changes to false otherwise your system might crash.  because it doesn't stop looping. 
A while loop can be stopped by using a break statement.

3) There also other loops that are not commonly used: For example the For in, For of, and do while loop. I didn't focus on them deeply.
